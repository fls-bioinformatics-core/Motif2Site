Description: Detect binding sites using motifs IUPAC sequence or bed coordinates and ChIP-seq experiments in bed or bam format. Combine/compare binding sites across experiments, tissues, or conditions. All normalization and differential steps are done using TMM-GLM method. Signal decomposition is done by setting motifs as the centers of the mixture of normal distribution curves.
